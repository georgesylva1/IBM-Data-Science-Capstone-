# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-
In this capstone, we predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage would land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, at a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, we tried to determine if the first stage would land. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch

We used different methods to extract the required information and also used various models to predict if launch will be successful.
